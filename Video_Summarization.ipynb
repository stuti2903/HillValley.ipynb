            " hey and welcome into the top three deadly opening traps for blitz and bullet and the first one's really dope and the really great thing about this opening trap is that it happens in one of the most played opening lines ever here after white goes bishop c4 knight f6 the two knights defense white ghost knight g5 aiming to attack your f7 square and in this position black usually plays pawn on d5 or sometimes bishop c5 but there is another move which seems really weird at first it's the move knight takes e4 and when you play a move like that it's very likely that your opponent will just think that you're a total beginner you are not understanding what you're doing because you know not only you're now protecting the f7 pawn which can now be captured which would only also attack your queen and rook you're also like giving away the knight it's almost like give up chess you know so it looks like you're doing something totally weird but of course there is a catch now first of all let me address the question what if i just capture your knight in this case there is no problem for you whatsoever because you go pawn of d5 with a double attack to the whites minor pieces bishop and knight inevitably you'll take one of them back on the next move and you're just having a great position but of course the main question is let me take a move back so here instead of taking your knight the main idea for white was to capture your opponent f7 and it looks like white can just go ahead and do this not only winning the pawn but also attacking your half a pieces hoping to grab one of them so it looks like white is just winning here but there we go with queen to h4 threatening queen takes f2 checkmate and at this point your opponent thinks okay okay he's so naive not only he blunders away all the his pieces but he's also really hoping to check mate me like this you know in a super uh simple way and so he goes pawn of g3 thinking that now you're done because obviously he prevented you from that checkmate and now on the next move he's going to capture your rook the queen is attacked looks like black is falling apart however this is precisely the moment for you to say something like and after that you play knight takes g3 all of a sudden you know it backfires for white and now white is actually losing let me show you how exactly it happens first of all you're attacking the rook not only you're destroying the white's position white can't really capture with a pawn because in this case uh the pawn is pinned and you can just go ahead and grab the rook attack the king and uh after king e2 you'll follow up with knight to d4 so here white is done so this version certainly doesn't work for white but what if he recaptures with a pawn in this case you go queen to e4 and you're attacking a whole lot of pieces in the white's position the king the rogue and the bishop and now you're certainly winning because you're also going to capture the rook with the check which is also important so what has no time to do anything apart from just protecting their cane for example they go king of one you just capture the rook checking the key and if king goes forward there is a lot that you can do actually but you can go knight to d4 and on the next move while the king goes away i'll just capture the queen and here you're totally winning why lost a lot of material and his kin is exposed and will probably be checkmated very soon after something like queen to f3 all right now we're back to the starting position for the strap the two knights defense at this point you go knight takes e4 so far we already saw that if my recapture is back it's not dangerous for you just push the pawn to d5 and you take one of the pieces back therefore this is not a problem for you if white tries to capture your pawn just like we have already analyzed after qh4 you're actually winning here so that is also bad for white now what should white should do is it just to you know resign and give up chess no definitely there must be the way for white the way is to take the pawn with the bishop but the good thing about this trap is that even after that white is very unlikely to find the correct continuation and i checked it in the database you know so you're safe here most players cannot find the right moves for right here after bishop takes f7 king e7 is forced and in this position the correct move for white which puts most trouble for black is actually pawn on d4 but it's really hard to find such a move during a real practical game and most players they just go ahead and take your knight which is not dangerous by the way if they go pawn on d3 which is also not that dangerous you just shouldn't take the knight obviously because in this case they'll recapture with the bishop and winner queen but if you just move your knight back you're you're good to go white is perhaps more active here but it's still perfectly playable for you here so the correct move for white is d4 but again most likely your opponents will never find it and they'll capture the knight which is what they do in the vast majority of the games and here black is still doing perfectly okay you're capturing the uh the bishop then after a queen of three check you go back to e8 and yes you can't castle anymore because your king made a couple moves but you have you know good center your other pawn is ready to push the knight is ready to jump to d4 to attack the queen as well as that pawn on c2 you've got two bishops therefore you've got plenty of the good things in this position as well and um yeah let me just show you one more line here which can happen again it's the most played moves actually white usually plays part of d3 you go up on d5 to kick off that knight they go knight g5 you go quinn f6 to cover the f sound square you're seemingly sacrificing the pawn on d5 but you're once again ready to trap your opponent and again most likely your opponents are gonna fall right into this trap because here you go knight to d4 and there is no good way for white to stop you from capturing the pawn and then the rook and the corner okay if y plays queen to c4 which looks like the only option for white really to protect the pawn then you go upon a b5 and you drive this queen away and you're gonna capture the pawn anyway so here it's already time for white to resign for example if they capture the pawn first you keep chasing the queen you go bishop d6 attacking the queen and now there is no good way for white you may wonder what if they go queen to c3 to keep protecting the pawn well you tell me please think about this i'm sure you can find the winning continuation for black here but you'll need to give it a little thinking so think about this and write it down in comments below how should black play here and actually this is really really practical because the line that i showed you so far is actually the most popular line in this variation therefore you have the chance to actually go ahead and execute the next move in your practical game here comes the second trap it's also pretty cool because even master and grandmaster level players fall victims of this trap it can happen after the first move either upon a d4 or pawn or e4 it works either way there if black tries to play something like perk defense or king's indian defense trying to find shadow their kingside bishop this thing can work so let's say right now they go pawn to d6 kind of preparing to push the pawn to e5 so we go knight to r3 to stop this to provide this additional control over the e5 square black may try doing the same playing knight or d7 eventually preparing pawn e5 on the next move and then you go pawn to e4 developing a piece and at this point fairly often they would go pawn on g6 to fune shadow their bishop because it's part of their plan if they go pawn to e5 right away it's actually still a little bit troublesome for black because after the exchange you can go bishop c4 and now there are various different problems for black to that potential weakness on the f7 and therefore it's still not that easy for black anyway let's go back here the move which they are likely to play is pawn on g6 preparing to find shadow their bishop now you go bishop c4 it looks like you're just developing a piece just like black do and here comes the the really fun thing in the vast majority of your games your opponent will play bishop to g7 let me show you a few funny statistics here this is the database of games okay so that just you know that we're talking about some real practical stuff right here as you can see the top plate move the first most played move is bishop to g7 which is losing it's a bad mistake but most players actually go ahead and play now if we're looking at the players who play this you see that there are players 2 900 2900 2800 really strong guys keep following you know victims of this trap and another fun thing is that most players who play this as white are unaware of this and they lose their this opportunity in just castle instead of playing bishop takes epson which is winning so it's really cool that you're watching this video because you won't be like these guys who who just castle here as you already know the winning move for right here is bishop takes f7 but anyway let me show you the follow up so that you know how to finish the game off black will recapture you go knight g5 check and at this point black realizes that it's time to resign and actually a lot of players do resign here because if they go king to f6 then obviously queen to f3 checkmate so this is really simple if king goes back either to f8 or e8 it does not really matter in this case because in both the cases you just go knight to e6 which attacks the queen in this case the coin is trapped it also simultaneously somewhat attacks the bishop and the pawn but in this case it's not really a matter because you're most likely just going to capture the queen on the next move well you definitely can and i hope you will win a couple games by following the opening traps that i'm showing to you still you cannot really hope to become a strong chess player just by using these occasional tricks here and there so if you want to take it to the next level then i would recommend that you click the link on the screen or down below and study the course eight aggressive chess openings where we prepared for you the top eight most aggressive chess openings which are aggressive and also solid therefore you're not losing a game you're not just hoping for a certain error of your opponent these are just proven openings that put you in a more aggressive position so that their maximize your chances of winning later and also just easier to play when you are an attacker because it's generally easier to attack rather than to defend so click the link on the screen and i'm sure you will like the course if you're interested or else let's continue with the trap number three the third trap is used as black when your opponent tries playing the king's gambit against you and in this case you can use the counter gambit pawn on d5 and after white captures the pawn you push your pawn on e4 which gives you some space advantage and provides prevents white from developing their knight normally therefore the main move for white is pawn on d3 you protect the pawn and after the exchange white may decide to start attacking your knight because otherwise as you can see with the errors black can continue with bishop c5 and then knight to f2 or bishop f2 somewhat attacking and disturbing white and therefore white may decide to just go ahead and play queen to e2 to put this knight under pressure the night is pinned and why is even hoping to win the knight because they may think that you just did something wrong but there you go with bishop to f5 protecting the knight and it turns out that well while it still looks dangerous for black you know there is still a pin over the black's knight but it's not that easy to win this knight right away because what can white do if they go knight to c3 there is no problem for you because you just go bishop b4 putting the p on there night as well and after that your castle and everything is just great therefore this definitely creates no problems for you if they try pono g4 with the idea to push your bishop away and after that you know to collect the knight on e4 it doesn't work as well even though a lot of players are actually going for a pawn of g4 they think that they're winning but they're not because there is queen to h4 check which is check to the king and after king goes to d1 now he can capture this pawn and actually also put a lot of problems for right here white may be thinking okay if the move g4 doesn't work immediately now let me play knight to f3 and just prepare that move because now the knight is covering the h4 square so your queen cannot go there anymore and white is ready to push their opponent still they're hoping to win your knight in this case you play as if nothing happened and you just play bishop c5 continuing your development now why think to themselves okay i got you man and they go pono g4 but you stay cool you just castle you give up the bishop and after they capture it you play rook to e8 now i start realizing that you had some ideas that it's not that you're just blunder the pace here because that rook puts this unpleasant pressure over the e file and black is ready to jump with their knight to f2 for example and then to attack a lot of pieces in the wise position so white is really in some sort of trouble and they may hope okay let me just close the file by playing knight to e5 this closes the file and yet again it renews the threat of queen takes e4 it looks really good for white at first but still here comes queen to h4 check which upsets the white's plans now for king d1 which is forced to follow up with knight to f2 check and uh yeah while it's just losing because you're taking a lot of the white species if they go king to d2 you can capture the pawn f4 and after king let's say to e1 you just capture that bishop on c1 and white will be checkmated on the next move this is one more cool trap that you can use to win games easily against your opponents who are playing the most natural moves and are unaware of this opening trap i hope that you like it if so give a like to this video and also you can click the link on the screen or down below and enroll into the course eight aggressive chess openings where you study the solid and yet aggressive openings that you can play in your bliss games over the board games against amateur players or against more experienced opponents so we selected the openings

            "hey and welcome into the top three deadly opening traps for blitz and bullet and the first one's really dope and the really great thing about this opening trap is that it happens in one of the most played opening lines ever here after white goes bishop c4 knight f6 the two knights defense white ghost knight g5 aiming to attack your f7 square and in this position black usually plays pawn on d5 or sometimes bishop c5 but there is another move which seems really weird at first it's the move knight takes e4 and when you play a move like that it's very likely that your opponent will just think that you're a total beginner you are not understanding what you're doing because you know not only you're now protecting the f7 pawn which can now be captured which would only also attack your queen and rook you're also like giving away the knight it's almost like give up chess you know so it looks like you're doing something totally weird but of course there is a catch now first of all let me address the question what if i just capture your knight in this case there is no problem for you whatsoever because you go pawn of d5 with a double attack to the whites minor pieces bishop and knight inevitably you'll take one of them back on the next move and you're just having a great position but of course the main question is let me take a move back so here instead of taking your knight the main idea for white was to capture your opponent f7 and it looks like white can just go ahead and do this not only winning the pawn but also attacking your half a pieces hoping to grab one of them so it looks like white is just winning here but there we go with queen to h4 threatening queen takes f2 checkmate and at this point your opponent thinks okay okay he's so naive not only he blunders away all the his pieces but he's also really hoping to check mate me like this you know in a super uh simple way and so he goes pawn of g3 thinking that now you're done because obviously he prevented you from that checkmate and now on the next move he's going to capture your rook the queen is attacked looks like black is falling apart however this is precisely the moment for you to say something like and after that you play knight takes g3 all of a sudden you know it backfires for white and now white is actually losing let me show you how exactly it happens first of all you're attacking the rook not only you're destroying the white's position white can't really capture with a pawn because in this case uh the pawn is pinned and you can just go ahead and grab the rook attack the king and uh after king e2 you'll follow up with knight to d4 so here white is done so this version certainly doesn't work for white but what if he recaptures with a pawn in this case you go queen to e4 and you're attacking a whole lot of pieces in the white's position the king the rogue and the bishop and now you're certainly winning because you're also going to capture the rook with the check which is also important so what has no time to do anything apart from just protecting their cane for example they go king of one you just capture the rook checking the key and if king goes forward there is a lot that you can do actually but you can go knight to d4 and on the next move while the king goes away i'll just capture the queen and here you're totally winning why lost a lot of material and his kin is exposed and will probably be checkmated very soon after something like queen to f3 all right now we're back to the starting position for the strap the two knights defense at this point you go knight takes e4 so far we already saw that if my recapture is back it's not dangerous for you just push the pawn to d5 and you take one of the pieces back therefore this is not a problem for you if white tries to capture your pawn just like we have already analyzed after qh4 you're actually winning here so that is also bad for white now what should white should do is it just to you know resign and give up chess no definitely there must be the way for white the way is to take the pawn with the bishop but the good thing about this trap is that even after that white is very unlikely to find the correct continuation and i checked it in the database you know so you're safe here most players cannot find the right moves for right here after bishop takes f7 king e7 is forced and in this position the correct move for white which puts most trouble for black is actually pawn on d4 but it's really hard to find such a move during a real practical game and most players they just go ahead and take your knight which is not dangerous by the way if they go pawn on d3 which is also not that dangerous you just shouldn't take the knight obviously because in this case they'll recapture with the bishop and winner queen but if you just move your knight back you're you're good to go white is perhaps more active here but it's still perfectly playable for you here so the correct move for white is d4 but again most likely your opponents will never find it and they'll capture the knight which is what they do in the vast majority of the games and here black is still doing perfectly okay you're capturing the uh the bishop then after a queen of three check you go back to e8 and yes you can't castle anymore because your king made a couple moves but you have you know good center your other pawn is ready to push the knight is ready to jump to d4 to attack the queen as well as that pawn on c2 you've got two bishops therefore you've got plenty of the good things in this position as well and um yeah let me just show you one more line here which can happen again it's the most played moves actually white usually plays part of d3 you go up on d5 to kick off that knight they go knight g5 you go quinn f6 to cover the f sound square you're seemingly sacrificing the pawn on d5 but you're once again ready to trap your opponent and again most likely your opponents are gonna fall right into this trap because here you go knight to d4 and there is no good way for white to stop you from capturing the pawn and then the rook and the corner okay if y plays queen to c4 which looks like the only option for white really to protect the pawn then you go upon a b5 and you drive this queen away and you're gonna capture the pawn anyway so here it's already time for white to resign for example if they capture the pawn first you keep chasing the queen you go bishop d6 attacking the queen and now there is no good way for white you may wonder what if they go queen to c3 to keep protecting the pawn well you tell me please think about this i'm sure you can find the winning continuation for black here but you'll need to give it a little thinking so think about this and write it down in comments below how should black play here and actually this is really really practical because the line that i showed you so far is actually the most popular line in this variation therefore you have the chance to actually go ahead and execute the next move in your practical game here comes the second trap it's also pretty cool because even master and grandmaster level players fall victims of this trap it can happen after the first move either upon a d4 or pawn or e4 it works either way there if black tries to play something like perk defense or king's indian defense trying to find shadow their kingside bishop this thing can work so let's say right now they go pawn to d6 kind of preparing to push the pawn to e5 so we go knight to r3 to stop this to provide this additional control over the e5 square black may try doing the same playing knight or d7 eventually preparing pawn e5 on the next move and then you go pawn to e4 developing a piece and at this point fairly often they would go pawn on g6 to fune shadow their bishop because it's part of their plan if they go pawn to e5 right away it's actually still a little bit troublesome for black because after the exchange you can go bishop c4 and now there are various different problems for black to that potential weakness on the f7 and therefore it's still not that easy for black anyway let's go back here the move which they are likely to play is pawn on g6 preparing to find shadow their bishop now you go bishop c4 it looks like you're just developing a piece just like black do and here comes the the really fun thing in the vast majority of your games your opponent will play bishop to g7 let me show you a few funny statistics here this is the database of games okay so that just you know that we're talking about some real practical stuff right here as you can see the top plate move the first most played move is bishop to g7 which is losing it's a bad mistake but most players actually go ahead and play now if we're looking at the players who play this you see that there are players 2 900 2900 2800 really strong guys keep following you know victims of this trap and another fun thing is that most players who play this as white are unaware of this and they lose their this opportunity in just castle instead of playing bishop takes epson which is winning so it's really cool that you're watching this video because you won't be like these guys who who just castle here as you already know the winning move for right here is bishop takes f7 but anyway let me show you the follow up so that you know how to finish the game off black will recapture you go knight g5 check and at this point black realizes that it's time to resign and actually a lot of players do resign here because if they go king to f6 then obviously queen to f3 checkmate so this is really simple if king goes back either to f8 or e8 it does not really matter in this case because in both the cases you just go knight to e6 which attacks the queen in this case the coin is trapped it also simultaneously somewhat attacks the bishop and the pawn but in this case it's not really a matter because you're most likely just going to capture the queen on the next move well you definitely can and i hope you will win a couple games by following the opening traps that i'm showing to you still you cannot really hope to become a strong chess player just by using these occasional tricks here and there so if you want to take it to the next level then i would recommend that you click the link on the screen or down below and study the course eight aggressive chess openings where we prepared for you the top eight most aggressive chess openings which are aggressive and also solid therefore you're not losing a game you're not just hoping for a certain error of your opponent these are just proven openings that put you in a more aggressive position so that their maximize your chances of winning later and also just easier to play when you are an attacker because it's generally easier to attack rather than to defend so click the link on the screen and i'm sure you will like the course if you're interested or else let's continue with the trap number three the third trap is used as black when your opponent tries playing the king's gambit against you and in this case you can use the counter gambit pawn on d5 and after white captures the pawn you push your pawn on e4 which gives you some space advantage and provides prevents white from developing their knight normally therefore the main move for white is pawn on d3 you protect the pawn and after the exchange white may decide to start attacking your knight because otherwise as you can see with the errors black can continue with bishop c5 and then knight to f2 or bishop f2 somewhat attacking and disturbing white and therefore white may decide to just go ahead and play queen to e2 to put this knight under pressure the night is pinned and why is even hoping to win the knight because they may think that you just did something wrong but there you go with bishop to f5 protecting the knight and it turns out that well while it still looks dangerous for black you know there is still a pin over the black's knight but it's not that easy to win this knight right away because what can white do if they go knight to c3 there is no problem for you because you just go bishop b4 putting the p on there night as well and after that your castle and everything is just great therefore this definitely creates no problems for you if they try pono g4 with the idea to push your bishop away and after that you know to collect the knight on e4 it doesn't work as well even though a lot of players are actually going for a pawn of g4 they think that they're winning but they're not because there is queen to h4 check which is check to the king and after king goes to d1 now he can capture this pawn and actually also put a lot of problems for right here white may be thinking okay if the move g4 doesn't work immediately now let me play knight to f3 and just prepare that move because now the knight is covering the h4 square so your queen cannot go there anymore and white is ready to push their opponent still they're hoping to win your knight in this case you play as if nothing happened and you just play bishop c5 continuing your development now why think to themselves okay i got you man and they go pono g4 but you stay cool you just castle you give up the bishop and after they capture it you play rook to e8 now i start realizing that you had some ideas that it's not that you're just blunder the pace here because that rook puts this unpleasant pressure over the e file and black is ready to jump with their knight to f2 for example and then to attack a lot of pieces in the wise position so white is really in some sort of trouble and they may hope okay let me just close the file by playing knight to e5 this closes the file and yet again it renews the threat of queen takes e4 it looks really good for white at first but still here comes queen to h4 check which upsets the white's plans now for king d1 which is forced to follow up with knight to f2 check and uh yeah while it's just losing because you're taking a lot of the white species if they go king to d2 you can capture the pawn f4 and after king let's say to e1 you just capture that bishop on c1 and white will be checkmated on the next move this is one more cool trap that you can use to win games easily against your opponents who are playing the most natural moves and are unaware of this opening trap i hope that you like it if so give a like to this video and also you can click the link on the screen or down below and enroll into the course eight aggressive chess openings where you study the solid and yet aggressive openings that you can play in your bliss games over the board games against amateur players or against more experienced opponents so we selected the openings

            "hey and welcome into the top three deadly opening traps for blitz and bullet and the first one's really dope and the really great thing about this opening trap is that it happens in one of the most played opening lines ever here after white goes bishop c4 knight f6 the two knights defense white ghost knight g5 aiming to attack your f7 square and in this position black usually plays pawn on d5 or sometimes bishop c5 but there is another move which seems really weird at first it's the move knight takes e4 and when you play a move like that it's very likely that your opponent will just think that you're a total beginner you are not understanding what you're doing because you know not only you're now protecting the f7 pawn which can now be captured which would only also attack your queen and rook you're also like giving away the knight it's almost like give up chess you know so it looks like you're doing something totally weird but of course there is a catch now first of all let me address the question what if i just capture your knight in this case there is no problem for you whatsoever because you go pawn of d5 with a double attack to the whites minor pieces bishop and knight inevitably you'll take one of them back on the next move and you're just having a great position but of course the main question is let me take a move back so here instead of taking your knight the main idea for white was to capture your opponent f7 and it looks like white can just go ahead and do this not only winning the pawn but also attacking your half a pieces hoping to grab one of them so it looks like white is just winning here but there we go with queen to h4 threatening queen takes f2 checkmate and at this point your opponent thinks okay okay he's so naive not only he blunders away all the his pieces but he's also really hoping to check mate me like this you know in a super uh simple way and so he goes pawn of g3 thinking that now you're done because obviously he prevented you from that checkmate and now on the next move he's going to capture your rook the queen is attacked looks like black is falling apart however this is precisely the moment for you to say something like and after that you play knight takes g3 all of a sudden you know it backfires for white and now white is actually losing let me show you how exactly it happens first of all you're attacking the rook not only you're destroying the white's position white can't really capture with a pawn because in this case uh the pawn is pinned and you can just go ahead and grab the rook attack the king and uh after king e2 you'll follow up with knight to d4 so here white is done so this version certainly doesn't work for white but what if he recaptures with a pawn in this case you go queen to e4 and you're attacking a whole lot of pieces in the white's position the king the rogue and the bishop and now you're certainly winning because you're also going to capture the rook with the check which is also important so what has no time to do anything apart from just protecting their cane for example they go king of one you just capture the rook checking the key and if king goes forward there is a lot that you can do actually but you can go knight to d4 and on the next move while the king goes away i'll just capture the queen and here you're totally winning why lost a lot of material and his kin is exposed and will probably be checkmated very soon after something like queen to f3 all right now we're back to the starting position for the strap the two knights defense at this point you go knight takes e4 so far we already saw that if my recapture is back it's not dangerous for you just push the pawn to d5 and you take one of the pieces back therefore this is not a problem for you if white tries to capture your pawn just like we have already analyzed after qh4 you're actually winning here so that is also bad for white now what should white should do is it just to you know resign and give up chess no definitely there must be the way for white the way is to take the pawn with the bishop but the good thing about this trap is that even after that white is very unlikely to find the correct continuation and i checked it in the database you know so you're safe here most players cannot find the right moves for right here after bishop takes f7 king e7 is forced and in this position the correct move for white which puts most trouble for black is actually pawn on d4 but it's really hard to find such a move during a real practical game and most players they just go ahead and take your knight which is not dangerous by the way if they go pawn on d3 which is also not that dangerous you just shouldn't take the knight obviously because in this case they'll recapture with the bishop and winner queen but if you just move your knight back you're you're good to go white is perhaps more active here but it's still perfectly playable for you here so the correct move for white is d4 but again most likely your opponents will never find it and they'll capture the knight which is what they do in the vast majority of the games and here black is still doing perfectly okay you're capturing the uh the bishop then after a queen of three check you go back to e8 and yes you can't castle anymore because your king made a couple moves but you have you know good center your other pawn is ready to push the knight is ready to jump to d4 to attack the queen as well as that pawn on c2 you've got two bishops therefore you've got plenty of the good things in this position as well and um yeah let me just show you one more line here which can happen again it's the most played moves actually white usually plays part of d3 you go up on d5 to kick off that knight they go knight g5 you go quinn f6 to cover the f sound square you're seemingly sacrificing the pawn on d5 but you're once again ready to trap your opponent and again most likely your opponents are gonna fall right into this trap because here you go knight to d4 and there is no good way for white to stop you from capturing the pawn and then the rook and the corner okay if y plays queen to c4 which looks like the only option for white really to protect the pawn then you go upon a b5 and you drive this queen away and you're gonna capture the pawn anyway so here it's already time for white to resign for example if they capture the pawn first you keep chasing the queen you go bishop d6 attacking the queen and now there is no good way for white you may wonder what if they go queen to c3 to keep protecting the pawn well you tell me please think about this i'm sure you can find the winning continuation for black here but you'll need to give it a little thinking so think about this and write it down in comments below how should black play here and actually this is really really practical because the line that i showed you so far is actually the most popular line in this variation therefore you have the chance to actually go ahead and execute the next move in your practical game here comes the second trap it's also pretty cool because even master and grandmaster level players fall victims of this trap it can happen after the first move either upon a d4 or pawn or e4 it works either way there if black tries to play something like perk defense or king's indian defense trying to find shadow their kingside bishop this thing can work so let's say right now they go pawn to d6 kind of preparing to push the pawn to e5 so we go knight to r3 to stop this to provide this additional control over the e5 square black may try doing the same playing knight or d7 eventually preparing pawn e5 on the next move and then you go pawn to e4 developing a piece and at this point fairly often they would go pawn on g6 to fune shadow their bishop because it's part of their plan if they go pawn to e5 right away it's actually still a little bit troublesome for black because after the exchange you can go bishop c4 and now there are various different problems for black to that potential weakness on the f7 and therefore it's still not that easy for black anyway let's go back here the move which they are likely to play is pawn on g6 preparing to find shadow their bishop now you go bishop c4 it looks like you're just developing a piece just like black do and here comes the the really fun thing in the vast majority of your games your opponent will play bishop to g7 let me show you a few funny statistics here this is the database of games okay so that just you know that we're talking about some real practical stuff right here as you can see the top plate move the first most played move is bishop to g7 which is losing it's a bad mistake but most players actually go ahead and play now if we're looking at the players who play this you see that there are players 2 900 2900 2800 really strong guys keep following you know victims of this trap and another fun thing is that most players who play this as white are unaware of this and they lose their this opportunity in just castle instead of playing bishop takes epson which is winning so it's really cool that you're watching this video because you won't be like these guys who who just castle here as you already know the winning move for right here is bishop takes f7 but anyway let me show you the follow up so that you know how to finish the game off black will recapture you go knight g5 check and at this point black realizes that it's time to resign and actually a lot of players do resign here because if they go king to f6 then obviously queen to f3 checkmate so this is really simple if king goes back either to f8 or e8 it does not really matter in this case because in both the cases you just go knight to e6 which attacks the queen in this case the coin is trapped it also simultaneously somewhat attacks the bishop and the pawn but in this case it's not really a matter because you're most likely just going to capture the queen on the next move well you definitely can and i hope you will win a couple games by following the opening traps that i'm showing to you still you cannot really hope to become a strong chess player just by using these occasional tricks here and there so if you want to take it to the next level then i would recommend that you click the link on the screen or down below and study the course eight aggressive chess openings where we prepared for you the top eight most aggressive chess openings which are aggressive and also solid therefore you're not losing a game you're not just hoping for a certain error of your opponent these are just proven openings that put you in a more aggressive position so that their maximize your chances of winning later and also just easier to play when you are an attacker because it's generally easier to attack rather than to defend so click the link on the screen and i'm sure you will like the course if you're interested or else let's continue with the trap number three the third trap is used as black when your opponent tries playing the king's gambit against you and in this case you can use the counter gambit pawn on d5 and after white captures the pawn you push your pawn on e4 which gives you some space advantage and provides prevents white from developing their knight normally therefore the main move for white is pawn on d3 you protect the pawn and after the exchange white may decide to start attacking your knight because otherwise as you can see with the errors black can continue with bishop c5 and then knight to f2 or bishop f2 somewhat attacking and disturbing white and therefore white may decide to just go ahead and play queen to e2 to put this knight under pressure the night is pinned and why is even hoping to win the knight because they may think that you just did something wrong but there you go with bishop to f5 protecting the knight and it turns out that well while it still looks dangerous for black you know there is still a pin over the black's knight but it's not that easy to win this knight right away because what can white do if they go knight to c3 there is no problem for you because you just go bishop b4 putting the p on there night as well and after that your castle and everything is just great therefore this definitely creates no problems for you if they try pono g4 with the idea to push your bishop away and after that you know to collect the knight on e4 it doesn't work as well even though a lot of players are actually going for a pawn of g4 they think that they're winning but they're not because there is queen to h4 check which is check to the king and after king goes to d1 now he can capture this pawn and actually also put a lot of problems for right here white may be thinking okay if the move g4 doesn't work immediately now let me play knight to f3 and just prepare that move because now the knight is covering the h4 square so your queen cannot go there anymore and white is ready to push their opponent still they're hoping to win your knight in this case you play as if nothing happened and you just play bishop c5 continuing your development now why think to themselves okay i got you man and they go pono g4 but you stay cool you just castle you give up the bishop and after they capture it you play rook to e8 now i start realizing that you had some ideas that it's not that you're just blunder the pace here because that rook puts this unpleasant pressure over the e file and black is ready to jump with their knight to f2 for example and then to attack a lot of pieces in the wise position so white is really in some sort of trouble and they may hope okay let me just close the file by playing knight to e5 this closes the file and yet again it renews the threat of queen takes e4 it looks really good for white at first but still here comes queen to h4 check which upsets the white's plans now for king d1 which is forced to follow up with knight to f2 check and uh yeah while it's just losing because you're taking a lot of the white species if they go king to d2 you can capture the pawn f4 and after king let's say to e1 you just capture that bishop on c1 and white will be checkmated on the next move this is one more cool trap that you can use to win games easily against your opponents who are playing the most natural moves and are unaware of this opening trap i hope that you like it if so give a like to this video and also you can click the link on the screen or down below and enroll into the course eight aggressive chess openings where you study the solid and yet aggressive openings that you can play in your bliss games over the board games against amateur players or against more experienced opponents so we selected the openings
